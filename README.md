# Trading MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges Claude/LLMs with financial trading APIs, providing seamless access to market data and trading capabilities through Anthropic's standardized protocol.

## üåü Overview

This MCP server combines two powerful financial APIs:
- **AlphaVantage**: Real-time and historical market data, technical indicators, company fundamentals
- **Upstox**: Indian stock market trading platform for executing buy/sell orders, portfolio management

By implementing the MCP protocol, this server acts as a "USB-C for AI" - allowing any MCP-compatible AI application to interact with financial markets without custom integration work.

## üöÄ Features

### AlphaVantage Integration
- **Real-time Stock Quotes**: Get current market prices and daily performance
- **Company Fundamentals**: Access detailed company overview and financial metrics  
- **Market Movers**: Track top gainers and losers in the market
- **Technical Analysis**: Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculations
- **Historical Data**: Daily and intraday time series data

### Upstox Trading Integration
- **Live Trading**: Execute market buy/sell orders in real-time
- **After Market Orders (AMO)**: Place orders for next trading session
- **Portfolio Management**: View holdings, P&L, and position details
- **Fund Management**: Check available margins and account balance
- **Order Management**: Track, modify, and cancel orders

### MCP Protocol Benefits
- **Standardized Interface**: Universal compatibility with MCP-enabled AI applications
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed tool schemas with validation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and user-friendly messages
- **Async Support**: Non-blocking operations for better performance

```

The architecture follows a clean three-tier design pattern:

1. **Client Layer (Claude/LLM)**: Handles user interactions through natural language, generates structured tool requests, and parses responses back to human-readable format

2. **MCP Server Layer**: Acts as the intelligent middleware that:
    - Translates LLM requests into API-specific calls
    - Validates input/output with strong typing
    - Manages asynchronous operations for optimal performance
    - Provides comprehensive error handling

3. **External API Layer**: Connects to financial data and trading services:
    - AlphaVantage for market data, technical indicators and fundamentals
    - Upstox for order execution, portfolio management and account operations
    - Implements caching and rate limiting for API efficiency

### Key Components

- **MCP Server**: Core protocol implementation using `mcp` library
- **Tool Handlers**: Individual functions for each API endpoint
- **Helper Functions**: Utility functions for API interactions
- **Error Management**: Comprehensive exception handling
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic schemas for request/response validation

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Store securely in environment variables, never commit to version control
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate delays between API calls
- **Trading Permissions**: Ensure proper Upstox API permissions for live trading
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before API calls
- **Error Logging**: Sensitive information is filtered from logs

## üß™ Testing


Test individual tools:
```bash
# Test AlphaVantage integration
python -c "import asyncio; from alphavantage.helper_function import fetch_quote; print(asyncio.run(fetch_quote('AAPL')))"

# Test Upstox integration (requires valid credentials)
python -c "import asyncio; from upstox.helper_functions import get_portfolio; print(asyncio.run(get_portfolio()))"
```

## üìà Performance & Rate Limits

### AlphaVantage
- **Free Tier**: 25 per day
- **Premium**: Higher limits available with paid plans
- **Caching**: Implement local caching for frequently requested data

### Upstox
- **Order Limits**: Based on your trading account limits
- **API Limits**: 10 requests per second for most endpoints
- **Real-time Data**: Market data updates based on subscription
